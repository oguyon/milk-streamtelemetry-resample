# milk-streamtelemetry-resample

Resample telemetry streams to a common timeframe.
This package contains two executables:
1. `milk-streamtelemetry-resample-mkts`: Scans telemetry logs and generates a resampling schedule (time series).
2. `milk-streamtelemetry-resample-applyts`: Applies the generated schedule to 3D FITS data cubes.

## Compilation

Coded in C for speed, compilation with gcc and cmake.
Uses CFITSIO library to load/write FITS files.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

This will produce two executables in the `build` directory:
- `milk-streamtelemetry-resample-mkts`
- `milk-streamtelemetry-resample-applyts`

## Usage

### 1. Generating the Time Series (mkts)

```
milk-streamtelemetry-resample-mkts <teldir> <sname> <tstart> <tend> <dt>

# teldir    telemetry directory
# sname     stream name
# tstart    start UT time, unix time [s]
# tend      end UT time, unix time, or relative to start time if first char is +
# dt        output time sampling [s]
```

The tstart and tend times can be unix seconds (floating point number, unit second) or in the form `UTYYYYMMDDTHH:HH:SS.SSS`. In the second form, tailing number (seconds for example) are optional and will be set to zero if not specified. The tend argument may be of the form `+SS.SSSS` (relative seconds to tstart) or `+MM:SS.SSSS` or `+HH:MM:SS.SSS` for longer time ranges.

The program will first display the start and end time in both unix seconds and UT date formats, with the time duration (tend-tstart) also given.

The program will then scan subdirectory(ies) of the form `YYYYMMDD/sname` for timing files, per the convention given in the [milk telemetry file format](https://github.com/oguyon/milk-streamtelemetry-scan/blob/main/TelemetryFormat.md). For example, if given this input:
```
milk-streamtelemetry-resample-mkts /mnt/data fastcam UT20251204T12:10 +12:05 0.01
```
the program will look for files of the form `/mnt/data/20251204/fastcam/fastcam_hh:mm:ss.sssssssss.txt` whith the `hh:mm:ss.sssssssss` part of the filename falling within  `12:10:00.000` and `12:12:05`. Additionally, the previous file will be included in the list of files scanned, as the time sample in the filename only shows the time at the beginning of sequence captured by the file. The program will list all such files to be scanned.

#### Output of mkts

The program generates an ASCII output file named `<sname>.resample.txt`. This file contains the list of input frames overlapping with the specified time range. The file starts with a header (lines starting with `#`) describing the columns.

The columns are:
1. **Global frame index**: Frame index starting at 0 for the first frame overlapping with the time range.
2. **Frame start time**: Frame start time in Unix seconds. This is assumed to be equal to the end time of the previous frame.
3. **Frame end time**: Frame end time in Unix seconds (acquisition time end).
4. **Source filename**: The `.txt` file where the frame was found.
5. **Local frame index**: The frame index within the source `.txt` file.
6. **Resampled start time**: Frame start time in the new resampled time unit (floating point number, 0.0 at `tstart`, incrementing by 1.0 for every `dt`).
7. **Resampled end time**: Frame end time in the new resampled time unit.

### 2. Applying the Time Series (applyts)

```
milk-streamtelemetry-resample-applyts <resample_file>

# resample_file   The .resample.txt file generated by mkts
```

This program takes the `.resample.txt` file generated by `mkts` and uses it to resample the actual data cubes. It assumes that for every input source filename `filename.txt` listed in the resample file, there exists a corresponding `filename.fits` 3D data cube in the same directory.

The program creates a new FITS file named `<sname>.resample.fits` (replacing `.txt` with `.fits` in the input argument). This output file contains the resampled 3D data cube. The dimensions will be `NAXIS1` x `NAXIS2` x `N_OUTPUT_FRAMES`, where `N_OUTPUT_FRAMES` is determined by the maximum resampled time index.

The resampling is done by distributing the flux of each input frame into the corresponding output frames based on the temporal overlap (columns 6 and 7 of the resample file). This is a time-weighted accumulation.

## Testing

The repo comes with a sample of telemetry files (.txt and .fits.header files). To test the program, run in the build directory:

1. Generate the schedule:
```
./milk-streamtelemetry-resample-mkts ../telemetrysample/ apapane UT20251106T10:20 +2.0 0.001
```
This creates `apapane.resample.txt`.

2. Apply the schedule (Note: this requires actual FITS data cubes corresponding to the sample .txt files. The sample only provides headers):
```
./milk-streamtelemetry-resample-applyts apapane.resample.txt
```
